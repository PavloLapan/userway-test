# Test Task for UserWay from Pavlo Lapan
    - added tested HTML page with images and text 
    - created functionallity for editing alt attributes for any image in page
    - we can also add/remove ONLY NEW sections based from the requirements
    - when user click on image - input became focused, which is user friendly
    - good looking UI, but some jumping elements when image focused ( minor bug ) 
    - cross-browser code, MutationObserver well-supported across modern browsers
    - added css for nicely-looking ui
    - from requirements - single function which can be applied to any html file
    - 3rd party libs didn`t used, it is vanilla js
